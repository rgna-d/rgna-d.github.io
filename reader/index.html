    <h1>Anxiety of Influence</h1>  
    
    The fear of Facebook-facilitated mind control appears to have died down. Cambridge Analytica, the firm that used Facebook data to build psychographic profiles of voting populations, has folded. Facebook’s user metrics and share price have recovered. But the initial furor over just how much data is being collected and how it’s being used was reminiscent of previous periodic  scandals in the advertising industry, of which Facebook is an intrinsic part. Throughout the 20th century, as new media extended the reach of advertising, the industry has had to both tout its necessity and defend itself against seeming too effective.

As culture became more saturated with advertising generally, conspiratorial concerns were raised about commercial brainwashing, psychological tricks in ads that rendered human decision-making irrelevant and branded products irresistible. Vance Packard’s 1957 book The Hidden Persuaders, an exposé of the then-burgeoning use of motivational research and depth psychology in the advertising industry, warned of how “people’s subsurface desires, needs, and drives were probed in order to find their points of vulnerability … Once these points of vulnerability were isolated, the psychological hooks were fashioned and baited and placed deep in the merchandising sea for unwary prospective customers.” In 1972, Wilson Bryan Key’s Subliminal Seduction took this premise further, warning of the hidden messages in ads that could manipulate consumers’ minds. The Facebook scandal is in this tradition, with algorithms and data analytics replacing sinister depth psychologists and hidden words in photos of ice cubes as the agents of our undoing.
